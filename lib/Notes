Notes: 

Things I need to do for this CLI_Project:
    1. Must be atleast two levels deep. 
    2. Must use a scrapper or an API 
    3. Get the information from the API and send save it into objects. 
  
  Steps on how to achieve this: 
  1. Pick an API (National Geographic News API)
  2. Make sure were able to obtain all the information we need from said API to build our app.
  3. Start thinking about the flow of your project. 
  
  #project flow: 
  1. I want to welcome the user to Natgeo. 
  2. Ask the user which category of news to chose from. 
  3. Bring up the latest stories of the day from that chosen category.
  4. Have the user be able to exand and read the story. 
  5. Click back out to main menu or category menu.  
  6. #If this is to complicated will just stick to top headlines and user can select which story to expand.
